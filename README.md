<!-- Overview -->
## Overview
This is a starter App includes a Laravel application equipped with the required auth processes and webhooks/actions that help you to create your Salla App which works with the [Salla APIs](https://docs.salla.dev/). Your App later can be published to the [Salla App Store](https://apps.salla.sa/) and be available for installation to any of Salla [Merchants Stores](https://s.salla.sa/).

What can you use this starter App for?
* Create a Salla App from scratch, e.g. chatbot app or shipping service app, or any amazing app from your idea.
* Modify/Customize any of your previous Apps in order to take the advantages given by this starter App.
<p align="right">(<a href="#top">back to top</a>)</p>

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

The starter App comes with an easy _1-command step_ that does the complete setup for your starter App. To be ready, you will need some prerequisites which will be listed hereafter.

### Prerequisites
- Create a Partner account at  [Salla Partner Portal](https://salla.partners/)
- For Laravel compatibility: `PHP >= 7.4, Composer package manager and MySql Database`

That is all!

### Installation
The installation process is straightforward as you will see in the below steps.

1. In your MySql Database: **create a database** with any name for example `laravel`.
2. Install [Salla CLI](https://github.com/SallaApp/Salla-CLI) via [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/): `npm install @salla.sa/cli -g` where you will be able to run the `salla` binary commands such as `salla app create` and `salla app create-webhook <event.name>`
<!-- 3. [Salla CLI](https://github.com/SallaApp/Salla-CLI): to run the `salla` binary commands such as `salla app create` and `salla app create-webhook <event.name>` -->

<!-- > The step will ask you to select the authorization mode for your App, which can be [Easy or Custom mode.](#auth-modes)
> In case you selected the _Custom_ mode for your App authorization, you will need to enter the **same callback Url you already entered in your App dashboard at the [Salla Partner Portal](https://salla.partners/)** -->

<p align="right">(<a href="#top">back to top</a>)</p>

## Usage

With [Salla CLI](https://github.com/SallaApp/Salla-CLI) installed, **run** the following command to create your Laravel starter app project: ```salla app create``` and follow on-screen instructions.

List of existing apps assocaited to your account will be displayed as well as an option to create your app on [Salla Partners Portal](https://salla.partners/). Afterwards, you will be presented with easy-to fill in information to create your app.

<p align="right">(<a href="#top">back to top</a>)</p>


## Configure Authorization Modes <span id='auth-modes'>

While creating your App in the [Salla Partners Portal](https://salla.partners/), you will see that Salla provids two methods for the OAuth protocol, which are the `Easy Mode` and the `Custom Mode`.
    
> During the setup process, the default _OAuth protocol_ will be set to the `Easy Mode`, which can be configured from the file [`.env`](.env).
> All of the setup's values/keys are stored in the `.env` file as we can see in the below image.

<p align="center"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/TvSCAWC.png" width="660" alt="Salla Laravel App folder structure"></p>

#### Easy Mode <span id='auth-modes.easy'>
    
This mode is the default mode for the authorization, which means that the `access token` is generated automatically at Salla's side back to you.
You may refer to the class [`StoreAuthorize`](app/Actions/App/StoreAuthorize.php#L18) which is defined inside [`app\Actions\App\StoreAuthorize.php`](app/Actions/App/StoreAuthorize.php) to get more details on how to receive and manage the `access token`


    
#### Custom Mode <span id='auth-modes.custom'>
    
A callback Url is the Url that is triggered when the App has been granted authorization. This should be a valid Url to which the merchant's browser is redirected. In this mode, you will need to set a custom callback url from the App dashboard at the [Salla Partner Portal](https://salla.partners/). This callback url will redirect the merchants who are interested in using your app into your App entry page where the access token is generated. Moreover, using the Salla CLI command `salla app serve`, your callback url will be automatically updated. 

You may refere to file [`app/Http/Controllers/OAuthController.php`](app/Http/Controllers/OAuthController.php) which contains the [`callback()`](app/Http/Controllers/OAuthController.php#L26) function. This function is responsible for generating the `access token`

> The custom url will redirect the merchant to the [Store Dashboard](https://s.salla.sa/apps) in order to access the Store where he needs your App to be installed.

<p align="right">(<a href="#top">back to top</a>)</p>

## Authorization Service
    
This project comes with a simple singleton authorization service to help you with managing the access and refresh tokens
    
```php
// set the current user or any user you want to use his access tokens
app('salla.auth')->forUser(auth()->user());

// Get the get the store details
/** Salla\OAuth2\Client\Provider\SallaUser::class **/
app('salla.auth')->getResourceOwner();

// Made an API request using the current access token of the user
app('salla.auth')->request('GET', 'https://api.salla.dev/admin/v2/products')['data'];
    
// Request a new access token
app('salla.auth')->getNewAccessToken();

// Save the access token
auth()->user()->token()->create([
    'merchant'      => 'id',
    'access_token'  => 'access token',
    'expires_in'    => 'expires in sec',
    'refresh_token' => 'refresh token'
]);
```

### Refreshing a Token

Access tokens expire after two weeks. Once expired, you will have to refresh a user’s access token. you can easily request a new access token via the current refresh token for any user like this

```php
try {
    // set the current user
    // or any user you want to refresh his access token
    app('salla.auth')
        ->forUser(auth()->user())
        ->getNewAccessToken();
    
    // by default the function `getNewAccessToken` will get a new access token 
    // and save the new access token to the same user you are set it in the `forUser` function
} catch (\League\OAuth2\Client\Provider\Exception\IdentityProviderException $exception) {
    // in case the token access token & refresh token is expired
    // you should redirect the user again to Salla authorization service to get a new token
    // return redirect()->route('oauth.redirect');
}
```
<br />

<!-- ## Examples

TBD -->
    
<!-- Webhooks -->

<p align="right">(<a href="#top">back to top</a>)</p>

## Webhooks
[Webhooks](https://docs.salla.dev/docs/merchant/ZG9jOjI0NTE3NDg1-webhook) simplify the communication between your App and [Salla APIs](https://docs.salla.dev/). In this way, you will be notified whenever your app receives payload/data from the Salla APIs. These webhooks are triggered along with many actions such as an order or product being created, a customer logs in, a coupon is applied, and much more.

### Create new Webhook/Action command
Salla already defined a list of the webhooks/actions that are triggered automatically. The predefined webhooks/actions can be found in the folder [`app/Actions`](https://github.com/SallaApp/Laravel-Start-Kit/tree/master/app/Actions).

Run the following command to create your webhook event:

```bash
salla app create-webhook <event.name>
```

You may find the supported [Webhook events](https://docs.salla.dev/docs/merchant/ZG9jOjI0NTE3NDg1-webhook#list-of-events) as follows:
